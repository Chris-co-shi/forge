# forge
Forge is a reusable Java foundation project that provides core runtime, concurrency, and execution infrastructure.

The project focuses on building reliable, framework-agnostic components using only the JDK, with an emphasis on clear execution models, controlled resource management, and predictable lifecycle behavior.

Forge is designed to be reused as a foundational layer in future business systems, while also serving as a platform for validating and evolving core Java engineering practices.
